## Hobbies

I have many things that I like. I like music and my favorite band is the Cuarteto de Nos from Uruguay, their lyrics are fantastic and, they don't have love songs! I like rock, pasillo, reggae and ecuadorian music. If you want, I'll leave you my spotify so you can see the songs that I like the most...

I love the food like the yaguarlocro, tripa mishqui (ecuadorian food is delicius), pizza, hamburguers, sushi or the rice and eggs (is the tipical ecuadorian food). Sometimes I cook in my house, not always but when I have time uuff, I prepare an octopus ceviche that they fall in love.
