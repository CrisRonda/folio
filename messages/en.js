  "folio0.problem":
    "This project was born out of the need to show my work to the world. Also, to show my web application development skills.",
  "folio0.solution": `As you can see I used an interesting range of libraries like: ThreeJS for 3D animations and use of models within the browser. On the other hand, Framer Motion for CSS animations. \r\nAnd all this I joined to NextJS to improve the performance of my portfolio. Finally transform this project into a Progressive Web App, so go ahead and try all the functionalities that I have added! `,

    "This project has the initial screens of any app that sells something. It also has animations to make it more attractive!\r\nThis app is built with Expo and React Native, so it has the same JavaScript code base for iOS and Android. ",
  "folio2.title": "Flutter Player",
  "folio2.problem":
    "In 2019 a new competitor appears in the world of 'Hybrid' applications and well I wanted to test it with this app created entirely with Dart and Flutter 1.0.",
  "folio2.solution":
    "The interesting thing about this application was to test the CustomPaint to draw the frequencies (obtained through the fft) of the song that is played.\r\nAlso the songs that are played are obtained from the Sound Cloud API.",
  "folio3.title": "Tracking App",
  "folio3.problem":
    "This project was a test to obtain the position of the device and calculate the distance traveled in a period of time.",
  "folio3.solution":
    "Use the React Native framework to create the necessary UI. To get the position of the device in the background use the library 'react-native-background-geolocation' because it has battery management.\r\nFinally, to save the data of each trace I used Redux to persist the data in the device memory.
